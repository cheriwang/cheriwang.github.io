                        focused on designing the <b>search, booking, and journaling</b> pages.

                        We started off by creating a mind map to generate a general list of questions to ask our potential users.
                        The four main topics we wanted to focus on were stigma, accessibility, trust, and education.<br>

                    peers to further understand the importance of accessible mental health resources, and to narrow in on needs
                    and wants for an app. One quote from a friend I interviewed that really stuck out to me was: <br><br><br>
                    <b class="semi"><p class="body" style="text-align:center;">‚ÄúMy mental health affects everything I do and my headspace, finding a proper therapist for my specific needs has

                        After our user interviews, we came to the conclusion that mental health
                        resources were pretty hard to come by, and that the process of even finding an
                        initial therapist was intimidating. Thus, we wanted to center our design around
                        accessibility, simplicity, and ease of use. Our main focus was summarized up with
                        the statement</p><br><br>

                    <p class="body"><br>From our interviews, we brainstormed a list of essential elements and features to incorporate
                        in the app through a card sort activity. Some features included a detailed and filterable search system, a clear rating system, mood/emotion tracker,
                        and an in app booking feature. We pulled inspiration from existing apps such as Yelp, AirBnb, and Clue.</p>

                <p class="body">Our client is currently building a local therapist database on our college campus,
                    and is looking for developers to bring his idea and our mockups to reality.
                    <br><br>
                    This was one of my first user experience projects, and I learned a lot more about <b>designing from start to finish</b>,
                    and <b>not just jumping straight to the visual design of a project</b>. With my previous experience with graphic
                    design, I tend to go right to my laptop and start creating. However, this project would not have been as
                    cohesive or successful without the research, user interviews, and testing we did.
                    <br><br>
                    As I grow more as a designer and learn more about user experience, I like to revisit this project and update it. Moving forward,
                        I have some ideas on how to continue improving on the work we did, including <b>creating and refining the therapist side</b> of the product, and
                        updating the design language to <b>increase usability</b>.
